#summary How To Trigger Multi-Payloads on Naked Duck Firmware

= The Naked Duck =

Its not the best piece of firmware I was hoping for, and its rather limited in its application.  But you can now trigger multiple payloads!

==Setup==
You need to create 3 files on the sdcard, and have a naked ducky (no case)
  # *inject.bin* - default; ducky will always run this on insertion into a computer
  # *inject2.bin*
  # *inject3.bin*


==Trigger==
Now how do we trigger inject2/3.bin???

With the ducky still connected and naked (no case, sucks I know), enable either
  # NUM_LOCK (inject2.bin)
  # CAPS_LOCK (inject3.bin).

Then push the reset switch on the naked duck, to trigger the 2nd/3rd payload.
