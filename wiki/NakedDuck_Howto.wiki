#summary How To Trigger Multi-Payloads on Naked Duck Firmware

= The Naked Duck =

Now trigger multiple payloads!

==Version 2==
===Setup===
You can create upto 4 files on the sdcard, and have a suited ducky (USB case on...)
  # *inject.bin* - default; ducky will always run this on insertion into a computer
  # *inject2.bin*
  # *inject3.bin*
  # *inject4.bin*

===Trigger===
Now how do we trigger additional payloads???

With the ducky still connected enable either:
  # NUM_LOCK (inject2.bin)
  # CAPS_LOCK (inject3.bin)
  # SCROLL_LOCK (inject4.bin)

*Warning*: use of these special keys in DuckyScript - will trigger additional payloads, meaning payloads may collide / interfere!

==Version 1==
===Setup===
You need to create 3 files on the sdcard, and have a naked ducky (no case)
  # *inject.bin* - default; ducky will always run this on insertion into a computer
  # *inject2.bin*
  # *inject3.bin*

===Trigger===
Now how do we trigger inject2/3.bin???

With the ducky still connected and naked (no case, sucks I know), enable either
  # NUM_LOCK (inject2.bin)
  # CAPS_LOCK (inject3.bin).

Then push the reset switch on the naked duck, to trigger the 2nd/3rd payload.
