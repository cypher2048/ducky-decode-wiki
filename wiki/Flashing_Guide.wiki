#summary How-to Flash / Update / Change the Firmware on the Ducky

= Programming/Flashing the Ducky =

==Windows==
When it comes to programming the Duck you'll need these resources for Windows: http://code.google.com/p/ducky-decode/source/browse/trunk/Flash/Duck%20Programming.zip . 

Additionally you may need JRE FLIP from http://www.atmel.com/tools/FLIP.aspx and be sure to use the drivers in the Programming.zip

*All relevant Flash files can be found in the SVN repo*

===Flashing===
First insert the ducky while continuously keeping the little black button pressed.

This puts the ducky into _dfu-mode_; we need to be in this mode to update the firmware.

It's pretty simple, just execute: 

{{{
program.bat newfirmware.hex 
}}}

==Unix/OSX==
On the Unix/OSX side grab these nice shell scripts to dump existing and program new firmware.
