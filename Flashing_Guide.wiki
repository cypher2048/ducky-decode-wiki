==Prerequisites==
===Windows===
When it comes to programming the Duck you'll need these resources for Windows: http://hak5.org/Duck%20Programming.zip . 

Additionally you may need JRE FLIP from http://www.atmel.com/tools/FLIP.aspx and be sure to use the drivers in the Programming.zip

*All relevant Flash files can be found in the SVN repo*

===Unix/OSX===
On the Unix/OSX side grab these nice shell scripts to dump existing and program new firmware. 
Available here: http://www.usbrubberducky.com/files/dfu-linux/

==Flashing==
First insert the ducky while continuously keeping the little black button pressed.

This puts the ducky into _dfu-mode_; we need to be in this mode to update the firmware.

It's pretty simple, just execute: 

{{{program.bat newfirmware.hex }}}
